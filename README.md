This is an Instagram clone without any backend functionality.  It displays an infinite scroll of images (pulled from unsplash.it API) with an author avatar, author name and comment count.  The count is a button (TouchableOpacity) that opens a Modal where the user can view the existing comments and add new ones.  This project is from the chapters *Core Components, Part 1 and 2* in **Fullstack React Native: The Complete Guide to React Native** (https://www.fullstackreact.com/react-native/#).
